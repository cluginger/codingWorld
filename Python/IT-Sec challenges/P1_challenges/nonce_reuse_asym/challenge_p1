In this paper, we utilize the previous methods and the protocol by Monteiro et al. 2015 to propose an efficient threshold ring signature. As a result, our scheme is more efficient than all previous multivariate threshold signature schemes in terms of both communication cost and signature length. In particular, the signature length of our scheme is 40% and 22% shorter than that of Petzoldt et al. and Zhang-Zhao respectively.
