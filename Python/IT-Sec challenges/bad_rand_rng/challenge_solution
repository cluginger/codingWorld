Smart metering, smart parking, health, environment monitoring, and other applications drive the deployment of the so-called Internet of Things(IoT). Whilst cost and energy efficiency are the main factors that con-tribute to the popularity of commercial devices in the IoT domain, security features are increasingly desired. Security features typically guarantee authenticity of devices and/or data, as well as confidentiality of data in transit. Our study finds that whilst cryptographic algorithms for confidentiality and authenticity are supported in hardware on a popular class of devices, there is no adequate support for random number generation available. We show how to passively manipulate the on-board source for randomness, and thereby we can completely undermine the security provided by (otherwise) strong cryptographic algorithms, with devastating results.
